##Inno Store
This is a website of a grocery store called "Inno Store". I have used EJS template engine to view the home page which gives layout of the website with navbar, main body and footer. 

# I have used three different data categories for products, branches and employees and created GET routes to expose to the client(in JSON format). Custom middlewares and error-handling middlewares are used in this application. 

# filter() is used to display different store locations based on States. The links at the footer will take us to the list of branches (in JSON format) in that particular State.

# Likewise "SHOP" is linked to the product list, "Our stores" is linked to list of all store branches and "Employee login" is linked to list of employees.
