#Inno Store
This is a website of a grocery store called "Inno Store". I have used EJS template engine to view the home page which gives layout of the website with navbar, main body and footer. 

## I have used three different data files for products, branches and employees and created GET routes to expose to the client(in JSON format). Custom middlewares and error-handling middlewares are used in this application. 

## Data filtering to display different store locations. The links at the footer takes us to the list of branches (in JSON format).

## Likewise SHOP is linked to the product list, Our stores is linked to list of all store branches and Employee login is linked to list of employees.
